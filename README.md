# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.
## /bin
This contains two scripts, linux.sh and cleanup.sh
linux.sh first checks to see if the operating system is linux, then 'sets up' my vimrc file here
cleanup.sh cleans up the set up that the previous script did
## /etc
This contains the 'settings' for bash and vim
## Makefile
This can and will execute the scripts in the bin file (Currently just linux.sh and cleanup.sh
